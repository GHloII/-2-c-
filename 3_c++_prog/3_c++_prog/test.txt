goood dayyyyy.
- Good afternoon, madam.
- Good afternoon, sir. How can I help you?
- Yes. I’d like to withdraw $ 500.
- But you could have used our ATM machine for that purpose. It’s very easy and fast.
- Well. I have just tried to access my account several times there. But I guess something is wrong with the machine.
- OK. Are you sure you entered the correct pin number?
- Absolutely. I’ve been your customer for about 10 years already and I’ve never been denied the access.
- OK, sir. Please, don’t worry. Let’s have a look at your account from my computer. Is it a saving or checking account?
- It’s a checking account. Here is my ID, madam.
- Thank you, Mr. Barney. Can I have your account number, please?
sooo.
- Sure. It’s 4558 6742.
- OK. … Well. There is nothing wrong with your account, sir. So, what kind of transactions are you going to make now?
- I want to deposit this check and withdraw $ 500, please.
- OK. The money from your check should be in your account within 3 working days.
- Yes, I know.
- How would you like your cash?
- In 50’s, please.
- Just a minute. Here is your cash, sir. Please, ensure that you’ve got the exact amount of money.
- Yes. Everything is right. And could I have my statement printed out, please?
- Certainly, sir. Here you are.
- Thank you for your help.
- Have a nice day!
